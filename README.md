This project is an implementation of a very simple neural network with 1 hidden
layer from scratch without using any external tools.


The following tutorials was a great guide for me

- [Implementing a Neural Network from Scratch in Python â€“ An Introduction](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/implementing-a-neural-network-from-scratch/)
- [How to Implement the Backpropagation Algorithm From Scratch In Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/)

Implementing the neural network manually requires understanding the math
beneath it and how the values are travelling through the neurons within the
network and the method used to train the network.

I'm suggesting watch the following Youtube series for a quick introduction to
what are we doing in general
